# Image Denoising: A Comparative Study of Classical and Deep Learning Approaches

## Overview

This project is a comparative study of image denoising techniques, focusing on classical methods and deep learning approaches. We use several datasets, including the Plant Phenotyping Dataset, Chest X-Ray Images, and the Celebrity Faces Dataset. The project consists of data preparation, classical denoising, deep learning denoising, and evaluation metrics computation.

## Datasets

1. **Plant Phenotyping Dataset**: This dataset contains 810 RGB plant images along with their truth masks.

2. **Chest X-Ray Images**: This dataset contains 5,863 grayscale images of patients' chests, both with and without Pneumonia.

3. **Celebrity Faces Dataset**: This dataset contains a large number of celebrity faces images. (Provide more details about the dataset here)
