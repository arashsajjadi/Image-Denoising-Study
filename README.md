# Comparative Study of Image Denoising Techniques

Welcome to our GitHub repository for the Image Denoising project, a comprehensive exploration and comparison of classical and deep learning approaches for image denoising, undertaken as a part of CMPT 819 at the University of Saskatchewan under the guidance of Professor Mark Eramian.

## Introduction

Led by Arash Sajjadi, in collaboration with Fatima Saberi and McKayla Boguski, this project delves into the realm of image processing with a focus on denoising techniques. Utilizing datasets from diverse fields such as agriculture, celebrity imaging, and medical diagnostics (chest X-rays), we have embarked on a methodical comparison to ascertain the effectiveness of traditional computing methods against the burgeoning field of deep learning in image denoising.

## Purpose

The aim of this study is to dissect and understand the intricacies of image denoising, contributing to the broader knowledge within computer vision. Through our rigorous comparison, we hope to illuminate the advantages and limitations of each approach, providing a foundation for future advancements in image processing.

## Technical Process

Our research process was bifurcated into classical methods and deep learning approaches for image denoising. The classical methods, led by McKayla Boguski, focused on established algorithms devoid of machine learning techniques. In contrast, the deep learning segment, spearheaded by Arash Sajjadi, harnessed the power of neural networks, particularly autoencoders, to adaptively learn and mitigate image noise.

The project's core involved comprehensive analyses, from PSNR and SSIM metrics to the downstream effects of denoising on image classification and segmentation tasks. Notably, Fatima Saberi's pivotal role in dataset preparation and augmentation was instrumental in enriching the training phase, enhancing the robustness of our comparative analysis.

## Results and Achievements

Our findings reveal a nuanced landscape where deep learning models, in many instances, outperform classical methods in adaptability and efficacy. However, the impact of denoising on further image processing tasks, such as segmentation, underscored the delicate balance between noise removal and the preservation of essential details critical for analysis.

## Repository Structure

- `src/`: Source codes for classical and deep learning denoising algorithms.
